### Welcome to my profile :blush:

My name's William, I'm Brazilian and was born and currently live in Porto Alegre - state of Rio Grande do Sul. Also, I've a Bachelor in Business Administration
      from <a href="http://www.saojudastadeu.edu.br/faculdade/">SÃ£o Judas Tadeu</a>. Currently I attend the Analysis and Systems Development course
      at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unisinos.br/">Unisinos</a> and am a Full-Stack Web Development student at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.betrybe.com/">Trybe</a>.

I do believe that technology is present in all areas and with it we have the possibility to cause positive impacts in the world and I want to be a part of it!
